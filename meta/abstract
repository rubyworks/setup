Every Rubyist is aware of Minero Aoki's ever useful
setup.rb script. It's how most of us used to install
our ruby programs before RubyGems came along.And it's
still mighty useful in certain scenarios, not the least
of which is the job of the distribution package managers.
Setup converts setup.rb into a stand-alone application.
No longer will you need distribute setup.rb with you
Ruby packages. Just instruct your users to use Setup.
