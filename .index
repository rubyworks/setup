summary: Setup.rb as a stand-alone application.
title: Setup
version: 5.2.0
name: setup
description: ! "Every Rubyist is aware of Minero Aoki's ever useful setup.rb script.
  \nIt's how most of us used to install our Ruby programs before RubyGems\ncame along.
  And it's still mighty useful in certain scenarios, not the\nleast of which is the
  job of the distribution package managers. While\nstill providing the usual setup.rb
  script that one can distribute with\na project, Setup also works as a stand-alone
  application. Instead of\ndistributing setup.rb with a package, just instruct your
  users to install\nRuby Setup and use it instead."
